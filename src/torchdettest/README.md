# torchdettest

```bash
cd /src/torchdettest
python test.py
```
## TODO
1. Integrate with linting tool
2. Modularise and add flag for specific operations. Make sure all operations in all supported pytorch versions are available.
4. Add logic for backprop
5. Add support for different datatypes ```.to(dtype)```
6. (Optional) Try to get weights/parameters as a parameter
